## Programming Task: Matrix Multiplication Adventure üßÆ‚ú®

In this task, you will embark on an adventure to create a program that performs matrix multiplication. You‚Äôll begin by delving into theoretical concepts, then gradually design and implement a Java application that reads matrix data from files, leverages class designs, and incorporates creative programming strategies. You will apply object-oriented principles and get creative with your solutions, experiencing the beauty and challenge of programming.

### Learning Goals

- **Using Data from Files to Instantiate Objects**: Master file I/O operations and instantiate objects from external data.
- **Designing Classes**: Develop well-structured classes for matrix operations.
- **Programming Creatively**: Explore various approaches to solving complex problems with a creative mindset.

---

### Exercise 1: Understanding Matrix Multiplication üìö

**Objective**: Deepen your understanding of matrix multiplication concepts.

- **Task**: Describe how matrix multiplication works, both mathematically and conceptually. Explain the requirements and conditions for two matrices to be multiplied (e.g., inner dimensions must match) and outline the resulting matrix dimensions. 

```plaintext
Consider matrices A (2x3) and B (3x2). What are the dimensions of the resulting matrix AB? Explain why multiplication is possible for these matrices.
```

---

### Exercise 2: File I/O and Object Instantiation Concepts üóÇÔ∏è

**Objective**: Grasp the process of using file data to instantiate objects.

- **Task**: Provide a theoretical answer to why reading data from files is crucial in larger systems and how it helps in creating dynamic objects. Discuss potential pitfalls, such as data integrity issues and exception handling, when instantiating objects from file data.

```plaintext
What are the benefits of reading matrix data from a file rather than hardcoding it into a program? Highlight potential challenges and how to handle them.
```

### Exercise 3: Designing a Matrix Class üìê

**Objective**: Design and implement a class to represent a matrix.

- **Task**: Create a Java class named `Matrix` with fields and methods that represent a mathematical matrix. Include methods for matrix multiplication, addition, and scaling (multiplication by a scalar).

```java
public class Matrix {
    // Fields and Constructor
    private double[][] data;
    public Matrix(double[][] data) {
        this.data = data.clone();
    }
    
    // Method for matrix multiplication
    public Matrix multiply(Matrix other) {
        // Implement matrix multiplication logic here
    }

    // Other matrix operations...
}
```

---

### Exercise 4: File Reading and Matrix Construction üìÑ‚û°Ô∏èüßä

**Objective**: Implement file I/O to create matrix objects dynamically.

- **Task**: Write a method in your `Matrix` class (or elsewhere) that reads matrix data from a `.txt` file and creates a `Matrix` object. Assume matrices are stored in files with rows and columns specified as lines.

```java
public static Matrix fromFile(String filename) {
    // Implement file reading and matrix instantiation logic
}
```

- **File Format Example**:
  ```plaintext
  3 3
  1.0 2.0 3.0
  4.0 5.0 6.0
  7.0 8.0 9.0
  ```

---

### Exercise 5: Building a Matrix Calculator üöÄ

**Objective**: Synthesize your knowledge to build a matrix calculator.

- **Task**: Create a Java application that reads two matrices‚Äô data from files, multiplies them, and outputs the result to the console. Handle exceptions and ensure that the data from files is valid for multiplication.

```java
public class MatrixCalculator {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            Matrix matrixA = Matrix.fromFile("matrixA.txt");
            Matrix matrixB = Matrix.fromFile("matrixB.txt");
            Matrix result = matrixA.multiply(matrixB);
            // Print the result
        } catch (IOException | IllegalArgumentException e) {
            // Handle exceptions
        }
    }
}
```

---

### Exercise 6: Extending Functionality with Creativity üåü

**Objective**: Extend your matrix program with creative features.

- **Task**: Implement additional features to your matrix calculator, such as saving results to a file, supporting user interaction through a console menu, or visualizing matrices in a graphical format.

- **Ideas for Extensions**:
  - Serialize matrix results to a file.
  - Implement command-line interface (CLI) options for different operations.
  - Visual matrix display using simple ASCII art or a graphical library like JavaFX.

---

### Final Notes üìù

- **Documentation**: Use Javadoc to thoroughly document your classes and methods.
- **Testing**: Ensure your program handles edge cases, such as non-conformable matrices or invalid file data.
- **Submission**: Provide all source code, including any additional files or instructions needed to run your program.

Enjoy your matrix multiplication adventure, and remember to test thoroughly and code creatively! Happy programming! üéâ
