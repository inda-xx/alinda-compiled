# üéÆ Simple Game Application Development Task

In this task, we'll develop a simple game application that includes player movement, scoring systems, and interactions with enemies. The task is designed to improve your understanding of using data from files to instantiate objects, designing classes, and programming creatively. The exercises are structured to progress from theoretical understanding to practical coding applications, culminating in a creative game project.

## üìö Learning Goals

- **Using Data from Files to Instantiate Objects**
  - Understand file formats and parsing techniques for data extraction.
  - Use file I/O classes to read data and convert it into object attributes.
  - Handle exceptions and ensure data integrity during object instantiation.

- **Designing Classes**
  - Identify class responsibilities and define clear interfaces.
  - Implement cohesive class structures with appropriate fields and methods.
  - Leverage design patterns to solve common problems and enhance class design.

- **Programming Creatively**
  - Explore different approaches to problem-solving and algorithm design.
  - Encourage experimentation and iteration to refine solutions.
  - Integrate user feedback and testing to improve program effectiveness and usability.

## üèÅ Task Overview

The task consists of six exercises that grow in complexity and challenge. Exercises 1 and 2 focus on theory, exercises 3 and 4 are practical coding challenges, and exercises 5 and 6 require significant learning and coding effort to build a complete game.

### üß† Exercise 1: Understanding File I/O in Game Development

**Goal:** Familiarize yourself with the concepts of file I/O and its applications in game development.

**Instructions:**

1. **Research File Formats:** Briefly describe various file formats (e.g., CSV, JSON, XML) and discuss their applicability in game development.
   
2. **File Parsing Techniques:** Discuss different techniques for parsing files and how they can be used to extract game data efficiently.

3. **Data Integrity Considerations:** Explain the importance of data integrity when reading from files and how exceptions can be handled gracefully in Java.

### üí° Exercise 2: Theoretical Foundations of Class Design

**Goal:** Deepen your understanding of class design principles in Java.

**Instructions:**

1. **Class Responsibilities:** Describe the process of identifying class responsibilities and how clear interfaces benefit software design.

2. **Cohesive Class Structures:** Explain the importance of cohesive class structures and how appropriate fields and methods contribute to maintainability.

3. **Design Patterns Exploration:** Choose a design pattern (e.g., Singleton, Strategy, Observer) and explain how it can be applied to improve class design in a game.

### üíª Exercise 3: Implementing File-Based Object Instantiation

**Goal:** Apply file I/O skills to instantiate game objects from a file.

**Instructions:**

1. **Create a Data File:** Prepare a data file for your game's levels, objects, and characters. Use a structured format like CSV or JSON.

2. **Code Implementation:** Write Java code to read the data file and instantiate corresponding game objects. Utilize try-catch blocks to handle potential file I/O exceptions.

```java
// Java code snippet to read data from a file
try (BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("game_data.csv"))) {
    String line;
    while ((line = reader.readLine()) != null) {
        // Parse the line and create game objects
    }
} catch (IOException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}
```

### üî® Exercise 4: Designing and Testing Custom Game Classes

**Goal:** Design custom classes for your game and test their implementation.

**Instructions:**

1. **Identify Key Classes:** Determine the essential classes for your game (e.g., Player, Enemy, Level, Score).

2. **Define Class Interfaces:** Write Java class interfaces that outline class responsibilities and methods.

3. **Test Your Classes:** Develop unit tests to ensure that your classes function correctly. Use a testing framework like JUnit for best practices.

```java
// Sample JUnit test for a Player class
@Test
public void testPlayerMovement() {
    Player player = new Player();
    player.move(Direction.NORTH);
    assertEquals(Direction.NORTH, player.getDirection());
}
```

### üöÄ Exercise 5: Building the Game Framework

**Goal:** Integrate your previous work to build a basic game framework.

**Instructions:**

1. **Combine Components:** Integrate file I/O and class design components to create a functional game loop that handles player input, enemy interactions, and scoring.

2. **Implement Gameplay Mechanics:** Define rules for player movement, scoring, and interactions with enemies, ensuring that game state is updated correctly.

3. **Refactor and Test:** Refactor code to improve readability and efficiency. Conduct thorough playtesting to identify and fix any bugs.

```java
// Pseudo-code for a basic game loop
while (gameIsRunning) {
    handlePlayerInput();
    updateGameState();
    renderGame();
}
```

---

### üé® Exercise 6: Creating a Complete Game Experience

**Goal:** Develop a complete game application with creative elements and polished gameplay.

**Instructions:**

1. **Design the Game World:** Create a compelling game environment with multiple levels or scenes using your class framework.

2. **Enhance User Experience:** Incorporate sound effects, graphics (if applicable), and user feedback to improve engagement.

3. **Iterate on Design:** Seek feedback from peers or potential users and iterate on the game design. Focus on balancing difficulty and enhancing fun.

4. **Final Presentation:** Prepare a brief presentation showcasing your game, highlighting unique features, challenges faced, and solutions implemented.
