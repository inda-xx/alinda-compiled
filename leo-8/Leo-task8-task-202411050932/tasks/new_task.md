## üïπÔ∏è Task: Create a Simple Game Application 

Welcome to this exciting task where you'll engage with designing, integrating, and enhancing a simple game application. Through a series of carefully crafted exercises, you will explore essential programming concepts while creating a dynamic and interactive game environment. The task involves player movement, scoring systems, and enemy interactions. Let's dive in!

### üåü Learning Goals:
1. **Using Data from Files to Instantiate Objects**
   - Understand and parse data from files to create dynamic game elements.
   - Implement file I/O for reading game configurations.
   - Handle exceptions to maintain data integrity.

2. **Designing Classes**
   - Effectively design classes with clear responsibilities and interfaces.
   - Implement cohesive class structures.
   - Apply design patterns for robust class design.

3. **Programming Creatively**
   - Explore creative approaches to problem-solving and algorithm design.
   - Experiment and iterate to refine game features.
   - Integrate user feedback to improve game usability and functionality.

### üå± Exercise Series

---

#### üß† Exercise 1: Understanding File Formats

**Objective:** Understand the fundamentals of file formats and parsing techniques.

- **Task:** Research different file formats (e.g., JSON, CSV, XML) that can be used for storing game data. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each format in terms of readability, ease of parsing, and flexibility in handling dynamic game data.
  
**Guiding Questions:**
- What are the considerations for choosing a file format for game data storage?
- How does file structure influence the complexity of data parsing in Java?

---

#### üìú Exercise 2: Designing Your Game Classes

**Objective:** Conceptualize and outline the core classes for your game.

- **Task:** Sketch a class diagram for your game. Identify at least three core classes (e.g., Player, Enemy, GameWorld) and define their responsibilities, fields, and methods. Consider how these classes will interact with each other.

**Guiding Questions:**
- How will each class contribute to the overall functionality of the game?
- What design patterns, like Singleton for game state or Observer for event handling, could be useful?

#### üíª Exercise 3: Loading Game Elements from Files

**Objective:** Implement the mechanism to read game data from a file and instantiate objects.

- **Task:** Create a method in a `GameLoader` class that reads a configuration file to initialize game elements like enemies and power-ups. Use the configuration file format you selected in Exercise 1.

```java
public class GameLoader {
    public void loadGameElements(String fileName) {
        // Implement file reading and object instantiation
    }
}
```

**Code Guidance:**
- Use `BufferedReader` or `Scanner` for file reading.
- Handle exceptions to manage file I/O errors gracefully.

#### üèóÔ∏è Exercise 4: Building the Game Logic

**Objective:** Develop the core logic for player movement and interactions.

- **Task:** Implement player movement in the game world. Extend the `Player` class with methods for moving and interacting with game elements. Use a simple grid or coordinate system for positioning.

**Code Snippet:**
```java
public class Player {
    private int x, y;
    
    public void move(char direction) {
        // Logic for moving based on direction ('W', 'A', 'S', 'D')
    }
}
```

**Guidance:**
- Validate movement to ensure players stay within bounds.
- Consider collisions with enemies or obstacles.

---

#### üëæ Exercise 5: Introducing Enemies and Scoring

**Objective:** Implement enemy interactions and a basic scoring system.

- **Task:** Extend the game to include enemy encounters. Create an `Enemy` class and implement logic for interactions between the player and enemies. Design a simple scoring system based on these interactions.

```java
public class Enemy {
    private int x, y;
    
    public void interact(Player player) {
        // Define behavior when interacting with the player
    }
}
```

**Implementation Steps:**
1. Position enemies within the game world.
2. Define rules for scoring (e.g., points for defeating enemies or avoiding them).

#### üèÜ Exercise 6: Polishing and Enhancing Your Game

**Objective:** Refine the game to make it more engaging and user-friendly.

- **Task:** Incorporate feedback mechanisms and aesthetic improvements. Implement a simple user interface and enhance game graphics using ASCII art or basic GUI components (Swing/JavaFX).

**Enhancement Ideas:**
- Add feedback for player actions.
- Implement a main menu and game over screen.
- Use sound effects or background music for a more immersive experience.

**Guidance:**
- Conduct user testing to gather feedback.
- Iterate on your design based on user feedback to improve the game playability and enjoyment.

### üìö Submission Checklist:

- Ensure all code is well-documented using Javadoc.
- Submit the entire project folder including configuration files.
- Supply a document outlining the game's narrative and user controls.
- Provide a diagram or sketch of the game design, highlighting class responsibilities and interactions.

By completing these exercises, you'll strengthen your skills in reading from files, designing classes, and applying creative thinking in programming contexts. Enjoy the process and remember to iterate based on feedback and testing!
