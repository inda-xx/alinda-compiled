### üìö Learning Goals

1. **Using Data from Files to Instantiate Objects**
   - Grasp file formats and parsing techniques to extract data.
   - Utilize file I/O classes to read data and transform it into object attributes.
   - Handle exceptions and maintain data integrity during object instantiation.

2. **Designing Classes**
   - Identify class responsibilities and craft clear interfaces.
   - Implement cohesive class structures with appropriate fields and methods.
   - Deploy design patterns to resolve common issues and enhance class design.

3. **Programming Creatively**
   - Explore various approaches to problem-solving and algorithm design.
   - Encourage experimentation and iteration to fine-tune solutions.
   - Incorporate user feedback and testing for improved functionality and user experience.

### üëü Exercise 1: Theory Dive - Understanding File-Based Object Instantiation 

**Objective:** Deepen your theoretical understanding of using data files to instantiate objects. 

- **Task:** Explain the process of parsing data from a file format, such as CSV or JSON, and mapping this data to object attributes in Java. 
- **Discussion Questions:** 
  - How do you decide which data format is best suited for your application?
  - What challenges might arise in ensuring data integrity when reading from files?

---

### üß† Exercise 2: Theoretical Exploration in Class Design 

**Objective:** Expand your understanding of class design principles.

- **Task:** Discuss how you would design a class in a game for "Player" and "Enemy" entities, focusing on their responsibilities, necessary fields, and methods. 
- **Discussion Questions:**
  - How can design patterns enhance the architecture of your class?
  - What considerations should be made for class interfaces to ease integration with other classes?

### üíª Exercise 3: Coding Basics - Loading Objects from Files

**Objective:** Implement basic code to load game elements from a file.

- **Task:** Write a Java program to read player stats and enemy types from a file and create respective objects. Ensure you handle potential exceptions.
  - **Files**: Assume a CSV file format with columns such as `ID,Name,Health,AttackPower` for both players and enemies.
  
```java
// A snippet for demonstration
public class GameLoader {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String fileName = "gameData.csv";
        List<Player> players = loadPlayersFrom(fileName);
        // Implement loading logic
    }
}

// Hypothetical method for loading players
private static List<Player> loadPlayersFrom(String fileName) {
    // Implement file reading and object instantiation logic
}
```

---

### üñåÔ∏è Exercise 4: Code Challenge - Designing and Creating Classes

**Objective:** Design and implement classes for a basic game structure.

- **Task:** Code the `Player`, `Enemy`, and `GameEnvironment` classes. Each should encapsulate appropriate properties and behavior.
  - **Focus:** Utilize class design principles to ensure scalability.

```java
// Example class for Player
public class Player {
    private String id;
    private String name;
    private int health;
    private int attackPower;
    // Methods like attack(), move(), etc.
}
```

### üéÆ Exercise 5: Advanced Coding - Integrating a Scoring System and Enemy Interaction

**Objective:** Expand the game's functionality by adding a scoring system and enemy interactions.

- **Task:** Modify the `GameEnvironment` to include a scoring system. Implement methods to handle player-enemy interactions, determining how scores are updated based on in-game events.
  - **Consideration:** Reflect interactions through point adjustments dependent on enemy defeated and player actions.

---

### ‚öîÔ∏è Exercise 6: Final Integration - Creative Game Development 

**Objective:** Combine all previous exercises into a fully functional, creatively designed game.

- **Task:** Develop a themed game incorporating all elements: player movement, enemy interaction, and a scoring system. Utilize data files to dynamically create a game world.
  - **Creative Freedom:** Choose a theme‚Äîsuch as a space adventure, dungeon crawl, or urban exploration‚Äîensuring your game has win/lose conditions and a coherent storyline.

#### üöÄ Steps to Success:
1. **Design your game world:** Create a map or storyline to outline your game.
2. **Implement player interactions:** Allow for movement across a dynamic environment filled with enemies.
3. **Develop a scoring mechanism:** Track points based on achievements and interactions.
4. **Test and iterate:** Playtest your game, refine the mechanics, and ensure a smooth user experience.
