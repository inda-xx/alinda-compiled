# Creating a Running-Inspired Game with Java

One of the main tasks of game development is to simulate motion and making decisions based on states and conditions. In this assignment, you will create a simple running-inspired game that involves characters moving along a path. The goal is to run as long as possible, avoiding obstacles, using the concepts of iteration, conditionals, and function overloading. Dive into Java programming exploring `boolean` expressions, loops, and function overloading while testing your scripts using JShell!

### üö® Troubleshooting Guide

If you encounter any issues while working, try the following steps:

1. Check the [posted issues](https://gits-15.sys.kth.se/inda-24/help/issues) to see if other students have encountered similar issues.
2. If not, create a new issue [here](https://gits-15.sys.kth.se/inda-24/help/issues/new) to seek assistance. Provide a clear title starting with "Task _x_: _summary of problem here_".
3. Attend the lab sessions scheduled in your timetable and ask a teaching assistant for help.

Collaborate with your peers, but ensure you independently work on coding solutions. Avoid submitting solutions generated by AI and make sure you understand and can explain your code.

### üèõÔ∏è Assignment: Crafting the Game Logic

In this task, you'll develop the core components of a simple running game, focusing on game loops, character movements, and obstacle detection.

#### Understanding Boolean Expressions and Operators

Before implementing loops in the game, grasp how to utilize boolean expressions to control game states:

- Define true/false cases in game logic, such as `isCharacterRunning` or `hasCollidedWithObstacle`.
- Utilize logical operators (`&&`, `||`, `!`) to evaluate and control game execution.

```java
boolean isCharacterRunning = true;
boolean hasCollidedWithObstacle = false;

if (isCharacterRunning && !hasCollidedWithObstacle) {
    System.out.println("Character is running smoothly!");
} else {
    System.out.println("Character stopped or collided.");
}
```

#### Managing Game Flow with Loops

##### Exercise 1: Running Status with While Loop

Implement a method within `Game.java`:

```java
public void checkRunningStatus()
```

Use a `while` loop to simulate a character running continuously until an obstacle is encountered or the player decides to stop (e.g., user hits a key). Consider using random events for obstacles or user inputs for stopping.

```java
int distanceCovered = 0;
boolean running = true;
Random random = new Random();

while (running) {
    distanceCovered++;
    boolean obstacleAppears = random.nextInt(100) < 5; // Assume 5% chance of an obstacle
    if (obstacleAppears) {
        running = false;
        System.out.println("Obstacle encountered! Run stopped.");
    }
}
System.out.println("Total distance covered: " + distanceCovered);
```

##### Exercise 2: For Loop to Track Laps

Extend `Game.java` by adding:

```java
public void trackLaps(int totalLaps)
```

Use a `for` loop to simulate running a given number of laps. Print statements indicating the start and end of each lap.

```java
for (int lap = 1; lap <= totalLaps; lap++) {
    System.out.println("Starting lap: " + lap);
    // Simulate lap time or conditions possibly
    System.out.println("Completed lap: " + lap);
}
```

##### Exercise 3: Function Overloading in Game Logic

Introduce function overloading to allow tracking either distance or time:

```java
public void trackProgress(int distance) {
    // Logic to handle distance-based progress
}

public void trackProgress(double time) {
    // Logic to handle time-based progress
}

trackProgress(500); // Track distance
trackProgress(5.5); // Track time
```

Utilize function overloading to demonstrate how the conditions during the game can be captured either in terms of distance or time.

#### Testing with JShell

Try running individual methods in JShell to debug and understand behavior without a full application. 

```bash
$ jshell Game.java
> Game g = new Game();
> g.checkRunningStatus();
```

JShell allows you to experiment swiftly with your Java logic. It is a vital tool for prototyping parts of your code and understanding how different segments behave in real-time.

This assignment combines game design elements with Java programming concepts such as boolean expressions, loops, and function overloading. The integration of JShell facilitates quick testing and iteration, making development lifecycle efficient. Embrace the challenge and enjoy crafting your simple yet engaging running-inspired game! üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüí®
