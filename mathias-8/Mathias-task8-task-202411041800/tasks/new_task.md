### 🏆 Project: Create Your Own Pokémon-Inspired Game

Welcome to an exciting opportunity to harness your programming skills and creativity to design a Pokémon-inspired game. This task will guide you through understanding core programming concepts such as file handling, class design, and creative programming to build a small-scale game application.

### Overview

In this project, you'll learn to:

- Use data from files to instantiate game objects dynamically.
- Design robust classes suited for an object-oriented game application.
- Program creatively to bring your game world to life.

The entire task is divided into exercises, starting from theoretical questions to gradually more complex programming challenges. 

---

### 💡 Exercise 1: Understanding Data Serialization

**Objective:** Develop a conceptual understanding of how data from files can be read and used to instantiate objects.

1. **Question:** Describe various file formats (e.g., CSV, JSON, XML) and their advantages in storing game data such as character attributes, item lists, and maps.
2. **Question:** Explain how data parsing works in Java and how it can be used to read data and convert it into object attributes.

📜 **Answer Format:** Provide detailed descriptions and examples of code snippets that demonstrate reading and parsing data in Java from your chosen file format.

---

### 💡 Exercise 2: Theoretical Foundations of Class Design

**Objective:** Get familiar with object-oriented class design principles.

1. **Question:** Discuss the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) and how it applies when designing classes for a game application.
2. **Question:** Explain why clear interfaces and encapsulation are crucial in maintaining scalable and maintainable code.

📜 **Answer Format:** Use diagrams and examples of class definitions to illustrate your explanations.

### 🛠 Exercise 3: Implementing File-Based Object Instantiation

**Objective:** Apply your knowledge to read a Pokémon species' data from a file and use it to create Pokémon objects.

1. **Task:** Create a file named `pokemon_data.csv` containing details about various Pokémon, such as name, type, and base stats.
2. **Task:** Write a class `PokemonReader` in Java that reads data from `pokemon_data.csv` and instantiates `Pokemon` objects. Ensure data integrity by managing exceptions.

```java
public class Pokemon {
    private String name;
    private String type;
    private int hitPoints;
    // Constructor and methods omitted for brevity
}

public class PokemonReader {
    public List<Pokemon> readFromFile(String filename) {
        // Implement file reading and object instantiation logic
    }
}
```

---

### 🛠 Exercise 4: Crafting Your Game Classes

**Objective:** Design and implement the core classes for your Pokémon-inspired game.

1. **Task:** Identify and create at least three essential classes for your game (e.g., `Trainer`, `BattleArena`, `Item`).
2. **Task:** Use UML diagrams to design class structures focusing on SRP and cohesive design practices. 

```java
public class Trainer {
    private String name;
    private List<Pokemon> pokemonTeam;
    // Constructors and methods for trainer actions
}

public class BattleArena {
    private Trainer trainer1;
    private Trainer trainer2;
    // Logic for managing Pokémon battles
}
```

📘 **Documentation:** Write explanations for class responsibilities and interactions.

---

### 🚀 Exercise 5: Build and Test Your Game World

**Objective:** Integrate your classes to set up an interactive game scenario.

1. **Task:** Create a simple game loop where trainers can select and battle Pokémon using your `BattleArena`.
2. **Task:** Implement simple AI behavior for a computer-controlled trainer.

```java
public class Game {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Initialize trainers, load Pokémon, and start a battle
    }
}
```

---

### 🎨 Exercise 6: Innovate and Enhance

**Objective:** Debug, optimize, and enhance your game with creative features.

1. **Task:** Add additional features such as Pokémon catching mechanics or items that affect battle outcomes.
2. **Task:** Solicit feedback from peers, refine your interaction model, and iterate on design for improved user experience.

🔍 **User Testing:** Conduct a brief testing phase and gather user feedback. Document the iterative changes made based on this feedback.
