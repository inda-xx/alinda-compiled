## 🎮 Text-Based Adventure Game - Project Task

Welcome to the Text-Based Adventure Game project! In this task, you'll use Java to create your own adventure game. Along the way, you'll learn to use data from files to instantiate objects, improve your class design skills, and enhance your creativity in programming. Ready to embark on this coding adventure? Let's get started!

### 🌟 Learning Goals

- **Using Data from Files to Instantiate Objects**
  - Learn to read and parse data from files to dynamically create objects, ensuring your applications handle data effectively.
- **Designing Classes**
  - Design well-structured, scalable, and maintainable Java classes to build a robust game architecture.
- **Programming Creatively**
  - Employ creative problem-solving techniques to develop engaging gameplay mechanics.

### 📚 Project Exercises

#### 📝 Exercise 1: Understanding File Data Formats

*Goal: Understand how file data can be structured for game design.*

1. **Theoretical Exploration**: Describe different file formats and structures you might use for storing game data. Consider formats like CSV, JSON, or custom text schemas. Discuss the pros and cons of each.

2. **Data Parsing Techniques**: Explain how you would parse data from a file in Java. Highlight the use of libraries or Java classes (such as `BufferedReader` and `Scanner`) for file I/O operations and the techniques for splitting and interpreting the data lines.

#### 🔍 Exercise 2: Class Design Principles

*Goal: Develop a solid understanding of class design in Java.*

1. **Identifying Responsibilities**: Describe how you would divide responsibilities among different classes in a text-based adventure game. Common classes might include `Player`, `Room`, `Item`, and `AdventureGame`.

2. **Design Patterns**: Research and outline a design pattern (like Factory, Singleton, or Strategy) that could be useful in your game architecture. Explain why it’s beneficial for your game's structure.

#### 💻 Exercise 3: Implementing File-Based Room Instantiation

*Goal: Apply file data to instantiate game rooms.*

1. **Method Design**: Write a method to read room data from a file and instantiate `Room` objects. Use the method header:
   ```java
   private void loadRoomsFromFile(String filename) throws IOException
   ```

2. **Implementing Parsing Logic**: Based on your understanding from Exercise 1, implement logic to read a file line by line, parse the data, and create `Room` objects with their attributes set from the file data.

#### 🛠 Exercise 4: Class Integration and Interactivity

*Goal: Integrate designed classes into a functional game.*

1. **Room Linking**: Extend your file parsing to link rooms together via exits. Design your file to contain both room and exit definitions, using your earlier schema.

2. **Player Interaction**: Implement simple commands for the player to interact with the game (e.g., moving between rooms or examining items). Ensure that your classes interact according to the principles discussed in Exercise 2.

#### 🌐 Exercise 5: Game Expansion and Enhancements

*Goal: Expand upon the basic game design with creative elements.*

1. **Add a New Feature**: Introduce an interactive feature, such as items the player can pick up or puzzles to solve within rooms. Create a new class for this feature and describe its integration into the overall gameplay.

2. **Game Win/Loss Conditions**: Implement conditions for winning or losing the game. Ensure these conditions are clearly communicated to the player and that the game loop is appropriately managed.

#### 🚀 Exercise 6: Final Game and Documentation

*Goal: Refine your game and provide comprehensive documentation.*

1. **Complete and Polish Your Game**: Review all aspects of your game, ensuring logical consistency and engaging gameplay. Refine your code by addressing any inefficiencies or bugs.

2. **Documentation**: Write Javadoc comments for all public classes and methods. Include a README file with:
   - Game overview and theme
   - Instructions on how to play and win/lose conditions
   - An explanation of your class design and any patterns used

3. **Visual Map**: Create a visual map of your game world. Use a diagramming tool or hand-draw and scan the map, detailing room connections and major game features.

### 🎯 Submission Checklist

- [ ] Data files with correct structure for rooms and exits.
- [ ] Functional code for parsing files into game objects.
- [ ] Clear, cohesive class design integrating all game elements.
- [ ] Creative enhancements applied and documented.
- [ ] Comprehensive Javadoc and README documentation.
- [ ] Game map illustrating world layout.

### 👩‍🎓 Tips and Motivation

- Approach this project iteratively, refining your design as you go.
- Embrace creativity in your game narrative and mechanics.
- Seek feedback from peers or instructors to enhance your game's refinement.

Good luck on your text-based adventure! 🚀 Use every opportunity to explore, learn, and create something unique and interactive.
