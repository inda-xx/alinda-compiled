            "#### Exercise 4.3.2 -- Validating input\n\n"

            "As opposed to setter methods that you may have written previously, it is important that you _validate_ the input to these methods.\n"
            "This simply means that you should ensure that the value you are trying to set is sensible (so between 1 and 12 for the hours, 0 and 59 for the minutes and seconds).\n"
            "If the method is called with an incorrect input value, you shouldn't change the time on the clock at all,\n"
            "so if the `hours` is currently set to `11`, and a user calls the method `setHours(-3)` the value of `hours` should still be set to `11`.\n\n"

            "Add two constructors to your `Clock.java` class. The first one should have the header\n"

            "```\n"
            "this constructor should set the time to the values provided by the user, but only if they are valid.\n"

            "```\n"
            "the result should be a clock with the time set to `12:01:23` since the hours do not have a valid value.\n\n"

            "> **Assistant's note:** How can two methods have the same name? ü§î The concept is called [function overloading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_overloading) (or *Ad hoc polymorphism*).\n"
            "> Since the methods have different *numbers of input parameters* (or *arity*), it is fine to give them the same name.\n"
            "> It is also possible to have the same number of parameters, but of different types, such as `add(int n)` and `add(double n)`.\n\n"

            "#### Exercise 4.3.4 -- Presenting the time\n\n"

            "In Java, the `toString` method is a predefined method available in all classes. It is used to create a string representation of an object.\n"
            "By default, the toString method returns a string containing the class name, followed by an `@` symbol and the object's `hash code` which is sort of a unique identifier for the object.\n"
            "However, this default implementation may not provide meaningful information about the object's state or attributes.\n\n"

            "You can try this default implementation by navigating to the folder where your `Clock.java` file is and type the following in your terminal:\n"
            "```bash\n"
            "jshell Clock.java\n"
            "Clock myClock = new Clock();\n"
            "myClock.toString();\n"
            "```\n\n"

            "Fortunately, in Java, we have the ability to `override` the toString method in our custom classes. By overriding the method, we can provide a customized string representation that better reflects the object's properties or behavior.\n"
            "This allows us to create more informative and human-readable representations of objects when needed.\n\n"

            "To override the toString method, we can follow these steps:\n"
            "   1. Define a `toString` method in our class with the same signature as the one in the Object class: `public String toString()`.\n"
            "   2. Provide our own implementation of the method's body to return the desired string representation of the object.\n\n"

            "Your task is to implement this method and make it return a string representation of the object's current time.\n"
            "This should be a string in the format `HH:MM:SS`. Make it so that the returned string always prints two digits for each time unit, even if the field value only contains one digit.\n"
            "For example, if the current hour is 10, minute = 5 and second = 0 the output should be `10:05:00`. You should be able to do this using if statements.\n\n"

            "> **Assistant's tip:** If you are interested in more compact ways of returning a string like this, feel free to check the [`String.format` method](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/String.html#format(java.lang.String,java.lang.Object...)).

            "A clock is not much use if it doesn't tick, so it's time to add a `tick`-method to your `Clock.java` file. This method should have the header\n"
            "```java\n"
            "public void tick()\n"
            "```\n"
            "When called, the method should increment the seconds by one, and increment the minutes and seconds as needed.\n"
            "If the time is `02:13:59` and `tick` is called, the time should go to `02:14:00`. The convention for a 12-hour clock is that the minutes and seconds go from `00` to `59`, but the hours go from `01` to `12`.\n"
            "We expect your clock to follow that convention.\n\n"

            "> **Assistant's tip:** You could solve this exercise using if statements, but your code will be much simpler if you use the remainder (`%`) operator.\n"
            "> This binary operator gives you the remainder of the first argument after integer division with the second argument, so `15 % 4` gives you `3`, since _15 = 4*3 + 3_.\n"
            "> Similarly, `16 % 4` gives you `0`, since _16_ is divisible by _4_.\n\n"

            "Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, 60 minutes in an hour, and 12 hours until it resets, we need to check for these special cases.\n"
            "Looping back around the current time unit can be done using the remainder operator as mentioned above, and by using if statements the next time unit can be incremented.\n"
            "To figure out in what order things need to be done, think about the edge case when the clock is `12:59:59` and the tick method is called.\n\n"

            "#### Exercise 4.3.6 -- Tick tock\n\n"
            "Let's add a final method to the `Clock` class. This method should have the header\n"
            "```java\n"
            "public void tick(int seconds)\n"
            "```\n"
            "and should use a loop (you can choose if you want to use for loop or a while loop) to call `tick()` repeatedly.\n"
            "As an example, if the time is currently `08:37:14` and the call `tick(57)` is made, the time should go to `08:38:11`.\n"
            "Add a call to `System.out.println` that prints the current time after each time the seconds are incremented.\n\n"

            "> **Assistant's note:** This is yet another example of _method (or function) overloading_, and you will see many more as you continue your Java adventures.\n\n"
