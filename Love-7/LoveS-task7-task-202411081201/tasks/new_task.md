### Task: Text Analysis with Java üéì

In this assignment, you will develop Java functionality to analyze textual data by integrating multiple programming concepts. This task will challenge you to apply these concepts in real-world applications and enhance your understanding by using Java documentation, reading from text files, and utilizing the `HashMap` class for data management.

#### Learning Goals

- **Using Documentation:** Learn to navigate Java documentation for efficient understanding and implementation of classes and libraries.
  
- **Reading from a Text File:** Gain proficiency in file I/O operations, focusing on reading data from text files using Java.

- **Using the `HashMap` Class:** Explore `HashMap` for storing and managing key-value pairs effectively.

### Exercises

#### Exercise 1: üìö Understanding Java Documentation

**Description:** Understand and explore how to find and use official Java documentation.

- **Task:** Explain how you would locate and use Java documentation for `BufferedReader` and `HashMap`. Write a short coherent description detailing:
  - How to navigate to the official Java API documentation.
  - How to understand example snippets provided.
  - Best practices to integrate code examples into your projects.

#### Exercise 2: üìÑ Concepts of File Reading in Java

**Description:** Conceptual understanding of reading files using Java.

- **Task:** Describe the process of reading a text file in Java, including:
  - Setting up file paths and understanding the necessary classes (`FileReader` and `BufferedReader`).
  - Handling exceptions using try-with-resources.
  - Provide detailed pseudocode of reading a text file line by line.

#### Exercise 3: üìù Implementing a File Reader Class

**Description:** Implement a class to read text from a file and store words.

- **Task:** Create a Java class `FileWordSplitter` in your project. 

  ```java
  public class FileWordSplitter {
      private ArrayList<String> words;
      
      public FileWordSplitter(String filename) {
          // Initialize words ArrayList
          // Read file and split text into words
      }
      
      public ArrayList<String> getWords() {
          return words;
      }
  }
  ```

- **Objective:** Fill in the constructor to read from a given filename and use Java library functions (e.g., `String.split`) to add words to the `words` list. Ensure to manage resources effectively.

#### Exercise 4: üìä Analyzing Text with `HashMap`

**Description:** Integrate `FileWordSplitter` with `HashMap` for analyzing word occurrences.

- **Task:** Create a class `FileTextAnalyzer`:

  ```java
  public class FileTextAnalyzer {
      private HashMap<String, Integer> wordOccurrences;
      
      public FileTextAnalyzer(String filename) {
          // Initialize wordOccurrences HashMap
          // Add words with their occurrence count
      }
      
      public int occurrencesOf(String word) {
          // Return count of the given word
      }
  }
  ```

- **Objective:** Create a `FileTextAnalyzer` object that populates `wordOccurrences` with the number of times each word appears. Make it case-insensitive.

#### Exercise 5: üìê Unique Word Analysis and Frequencies

**Description:** Extend your `FileTextAnalyzer` for more detailed analyses.

- **Task:**

  - **Method 1:** Implement `public int uniqueWordCount()` to return the total number of unique words.
  - **Method 2:** Implement `public double frequencyOf(String word)` to return the frequency of a specific word in the text. Use conversion to ensure fractional results.

- **Objective:** Use `HashMap` capabilities to extract more insights about the text, ensuring methods are robust and efficient.

#### Exercise 6: üîç Advanced Textual Analysis

**Description:** Conduct detailed linguistic analysis utilizing all implemented functionalities.

- **Task:** Create a comprehensive report (in markdown or a text document) using your Java applications to analyze a given text file (e.g., a sample provided by your instructor).
  - **Include:** Total words, unique words count, frequency of selected keywords.
  - Provide insights about the text based on your analysis.
