### üìö Java Programming Task: Build a Word Counter

Welcome to this programming task! In this exercise, you'll develop a Java program that reads text from a file and counts the occurrence of each word using a `HashMap`. This task will help you understand how to navigate Java documentation, perform file I/O operations, and leverage the powerful `HashMap` class for data processing. Let's dive into the exercises!

### üìù Exercise 1: Navigating Java Documentation

**Learning Objective:** Utilize official Java documentation to understand and implement Java classes.

**Description:** Begin by exploring the Java documentation. Understand the basic structure and components of Java's API Reference:

- **Explore:** Visit the [official Java documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/10/docs/api/overview-summary.html).
- **Task:** Find the documentation for `HashMap`, `BufferedReader`, and `FileReader`.
- **Questions:**
  1. What are the key methods available in the `HashMap` class?
  2. How does a `BufferedReader` read data from a file?

---

### üìÇ Exercise 2: Understanding File I/O in Java

**Learning Objective:** Gain knowledge of file I/O operations in Java.

**Description:** Learn how to set up file paths and use classes for reading text files:

- **Query:** Explain the significance of file streams in Java. How are `FileReader` and `BufferedReader` used for efficient file I/O?
- **Questions:**
  1. Describe the process of handling file not found exceptions in Java.
  2. What is the benefit of using `try-with-resources` in Java?

### üîß Exercise 3: Implementing File Reading

**Learning Objective:** Practice reading from a text file and storing data.

**Task:** Write a Java class `FileWordReader` to read words from a text file:

- **Requirements:**
  1. Implement a constructor `public FileWordReader(String fileName)` that initializes the file path.
  2. Use a `BufferedReader` to read the file in the constructor, line by line.
  3. Split lines into words using `String.split("\\s+")` and store them in an `ArrayList<String>` called `words`.

```java
public class FileWordReader {
    private ArrayList<String> words = new ArrayList<>();

    public FileWordReader(String fileName) {
        try (BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(fileName))) {
            String line;
            while ((line = reader.readLine()) != null) {
                String[] wordsArray = line.split("\\s+");
                words.addAll(Arrays.asList(wordsArray));
            }
        } catch (IOException e) {
            System.out.println("An error occurred: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }

    public ArrayList<String> getWords() {
        return words;
    }
}
```

### üîç Exercise 4: Building the Word Counter

**Learning Objective:** Use `HashMap` to count occurrences of words.

**Task:** Create a `WordCounter` class:

- **Requirements:**
  1. Include a private `HashMap<String, Integer>` to track word counts.
  2. Implement a method `public void countWords(ArrayList<String> words)` that populates the `HashMap` with word frequencies.
  3. Use `lowercase` for keys to ensure case insensitivity.

```java
public class WordCounter {
    private HashMap<String, Integer> wordCounts = new HashMap<>();

    public void countWords(ArrayList<String> words) {
        for (String word : words) {
            word = word.toLowerCase();
            wordCounts.merge(word, 1, Integer::sum);
        }
    }

    public HashMap<String, Integer> getWordCounts() {
        return wordCounts;
    }
}
```

### üöÄ Exercise 5: Advanced Word Counter Operations

**Learning Objective:** Implement complex operations using `HashMap`.

**Task:** Extend the `WordCounter` with additional functionalities:

- **Method:** `public int getOccurrencesOf(String word)`
  - Return the number of occurrences of a specific word.
- **Method:** `public double getFrequencyOf(String word, int totalWords)`
  - Calculate the frequency of a word as a proportion of the total words.

```java
public int getOccurrencesOf(String word) {
    return wordCounts.getOrDefault(word.toLowerCase(), 0);
}

public double getFrequencyOf(String word, int totalWords) {
    int count = getOccurrencesOf(word);
    return (double) count / totalWords;
}
```

### üèÜ Exercise 6: Comprehensive Text Analysis

**Learning Objective:** Perform complete analysis of text data.

**Task:** Bring everything together to analyze a text file:

- **Program:** Create a `TextAnalyzer` class to utilize `FileWordReader` and `WordCounter`.
- **Objective:**
  1. Calculate the total number of words.
  2. Determine and display the top 10 most frequent words.
  3. Identify the number of unique words.

```java
public class TextAnalyzer {
    private FileWordReader reader;
    private WordCounter counter;

    public TextAnalyzer(String fileName) {
        this.reader = new FileWordReader(fileName);
        this.counter = new WordCounter();
        counter.countWords(reader.getWords());
    }

    public int totalWords() {
        return reader.getWords().size();
    }

    public List<Map.Entry<String, Integer>> topFrequentWords(int n) {
        return counter.getWordCounts().entrySet().stream()
            .sorted(Map.Entry.<String, Integer>comparingByValue().reversed())
            .limit(n)
            .collect(Collectors.toList());
    }

    public int uniqueWordCount() {
        return counter.getWordCounts().size();
    }
}
```
