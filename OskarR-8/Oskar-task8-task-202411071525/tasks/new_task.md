### Task: **Fantasy Library Adventure System**

Welcome to the Fantasy Library Adventure System task! In this task, you will explore the fascinating world of using data from files, designing classes, and creative programming to bring a fantasy library to life. You will develop a Java program that simulates a library of magical books, where each book holds unique spells, stories, and mysteries! Let's embark on this magical journey and deepen your understanding of object-oriented programming concepts.

#### Learning Goals

- **Using Data from Files to Instantiate Objects**
  - Master the skill of reading and parsing data from files, essential for creating dynamic object instances.
  - Utilize file I/O classes to efficiently read and convert data into object attributes.
  - Handle exceptions gracefully to maintain data integrity during object instantiation.

- **Designing Classes**
  - Identify class responsibilities and create clear, well-defined interfaces.
  - Implement cohesive class structures with suitable methods and fields.
  - Apply design patterns to solve common programming challenges.

- **Programming Creatively**
  - Explore various approaches to problem-solving and algorithm design.
  - Encourage experimentation and iteration to refine solutions.
  - Integrate user feedback and testing to enhance the effectiveness and usability of your program.

### üìù Exercise 1: Understanding File Formats and Parsing Techniques

**Objective:** Develop a theoretical understanding of file formats and practical parsing techniques.

- **Task:** Research various file formats (e.g., CSV, JSON, XML) and their use cases. Write a brief report (approximately 500 words) covering:
  - The characteristics of each file format.
  - The benefits and drawbacks of using each format.
  - Parsing techniques used to extract data from these formats.

- **Outcome:** Identify suitable file formats for different instances of data storage and know how to extract necessary data efficiently.

---

### üìù Exercise 2: Class Responsibilities and Design Patterns

**Objective:** Understand the principles of class responsibilities and the role of design patterns in class design.

- **Task:** Answer the following:
  - Explain the importance of defining clear class responsibilities in object-oriented design.
  - Describe how design patterns, such as Singleton and Factory, can enhance class design. Use examples to illustrate your points.

- **Outcome:** Grasp the basics of designing clear class structures and understand how design patterns can be applied to improve code quality.

### üë®‚Äçüíª Exercise 3: Instantiating Objects from File Data

**Objective:** Apply your understanding of file I/O to create Java objects dynamically.

- **Task:** Use a CSV file named `books.csv` that contains information about various magical books (title, author, genre, magicScore). Write a Java program that:
  - Reads the data from `books.csv`.
  - Creates and initializes a `Book` object for each entry in the file.
  - Handles exceptions where the file might be missing or the data might be corrupted.

- **Sample `books.csv` content:**
  ```
  Title,Author,Genre,MagicScore
  "The Enchanted Forest","Elena Spark","Fantasy",85
  "Dragon Tales","John Fire","Adventure",90
  ```

- **Outcome:** Learn how to dynamically populate objects using data from external files and handle potential exceptions.

---

### üë®‚Äçüíª Exercise 4: Designing the Book Class

**Objective:** Design an effective class structure for the objects instantiated in the previous exercise.

- **Task:** Create a comprehensive `Book` class with:
  - Proper encapsulation of attributes.
  - Methods to get and set class attributes.
  - A method to display a book‚Äôs overview (formatted string of all attributes).

- **Outcome:** Gain insights into the development of a cohesive and well-structured class that satisfies the project requirements.

---

### üöÄ Exercise 5: Building the Fantasy Library System

**Objective:** Create a cohesive library system leveraging your previous exercises.

- **Task:** Develop a `Library` class that manages a collection of `Book` objects. Your system should:
  - Allow adding new books to the collection.
  - Search for books by title or author and return relevant results.
  - Display a list of all books sorted by their magic score.

- **Outcome:** Achieve practical experience in designing and implementing a system composed of multiple classes working together.

---

### üöÄ Exercise 6: Crafting Your Adventure

**Objective:** Allow creative exploration by expanding your fantasy library.

- **Task:** Extend your project by:
  - Implementing additional features like genre-based filtering.
  - Introducing an interactive text-based interface allowing users to perform the library functions.
  - Document your code with Javadoc, detailing the purpose and functionality of classes and methods.

- **Outcome:** Enhance the functionality of your system, demonstrating creativity and problem-solving skills.

### üé® Final Thoughts

As you progress through these tasks, keep creativity at the forefront. Cultivate an environment of curiosity and playfulness as you solve these programming challenges. Your task will culminate in a fully functional fantasy library system, showcasing your mastery of Java, object-oriented programming, and creative problem-solving.

Good luck, and may your code be ever magical! üåü
