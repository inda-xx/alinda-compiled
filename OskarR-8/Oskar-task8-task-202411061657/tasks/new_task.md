### üöÄ Sci-Fi Adventure: Repair the Star Voyager

Welcome to the thrilling world of **"Star Voyager"**, where you are the chief engineer aboard an interstellar spacecraft facing imminent danger. Your mission is to traverse through various rooms of the spaceship, collect essential items, and fix the malfunctions before it's too late!

This task incorporates essential programming concepts while fostering creative problem-solving through interactive game development.

### üìö Learning Objectives

1. **Using Data from Files to Instantiate Objects**
   - Understand and apply file parsing and data extraction.
   - Utilize file I/O for object instantiation.
   - Handle exceptions and ensure data integrity.

2. **Designing Classes**
   - Identify class responsibilities and interfaces.
   - Implement cohesive and modular class structures.
   - Apply design patterns for enhanced class design.

3. **Programming Creatively**
   - Explore creative approaches to game design and problem-solving.
   - Experiment and iterate solutions.
   - Integrate user feedback to refine game efficacy.

## üìñ Exercises Outline

### Exercise 1: Understanding File Formats and Parsing üö¶

**Objective**: Establish a foundational understanding of file parsing relevant to game development.

**Instructions**:
- Research and summarize different file formats commonly used in game development (e.g., JSON, XML, CSV).
- Explain how data parsing is used to instantiate objects in a game context.
- **Deliverable**: A short report (300-500 words) explaining chosen file formats and parsing techniques.

### Exercise 2: Designing Classes for a Sci-Fi Game ü§ñ

**Objective**: Plan the class structure for your game.

**Instructions**:
- Identify key classes needed for the "Star Voyager" game, such as `Room`, `Item`, `Player`, `Spaceship`.
- Define class responsibilities, attributes, and methods.
- Illustrate a UML diagram for the game‚Äôs class architecture.
- **Deliverable**: A UML diagram and explanatory notes on class design.

### Exercise 3: File I/O in Java for Game Initialization üìÇ

**Objective**: Implement file reading to initialize game objects.

**Instructions**:
- Write a method, `loadGameComponents(String filename)`, to read room and item data from a file and instantiate corresponding objects.
- Ensure the process handles exceptions gracefully and maintains data integrity.
- **Code Snippet**:
  ```java
  private void loadGameComponents(String filename) throws IOException {
      // Example logic for reading and instantiating objects
      // Ensure data is correctly parsed and integrated into game state
  }
  ```
- **Deliverable**: Functional code that successfully reads from a provided data file and initializes game objects.

### Exercise 4: Implementing Interactive Environment ‚öôÔ∏è

**Objective**: Integrate class designs into an interactive game environment.

**Instructions**:
- Utilize classes from Exercise 2 to set up an interactive environment where the player can move between rooms and interact with items.
- Implement a basic game loop for player actions (e.g., move, pick up item).
- **Deliverable**: A rudimentary interactive environment demonstrating player navigation and interaction.

### Exercise 5: Expanding the Game World üåå

**Objective**: Scale up your game with additional complexity and functionality.

**Step-by-Step Instructions**:
1. Extend the game world to include at least 8 unique room types.
2. Implement complex item interactions, such as combining items to repair ship components.
3. Add a "win condition" where the player successfully repairs the spacecraft:
   - Create a method to check if repair objectives are met.
   - Display a victory message once the player completes all objectives.

**Deliverable**: A complete game environment with detailed item interactions and a winning condition.

### Exercise 6: Testing, Feedback, and Iteration üîÑ

**Objective**: Refine your game through testing and feedback.

**Instructions**:
- Conduct user testing with peers and document feedback.
- Iterate on the design based on the feedback, focusing on improving user experience and game mechanics.
- Provide a summary of the changes made and their impact on gameplay.
- **Deliverable**: A refined game version along with a report (200-300 words) summarizing user feedback and subsequent changes.

## üåü Submission Requirements

- All code and documentation should be submitted in a GitHub repository.
- Include a `README.md` detailing installation instructions, game mechanics, and gameplay objectives.
- Ensure all classes and methods are documented using Javadoc for clarity.
- Submit the UML diagram and feedback report in the `docs` directory.

## üåå Bonus Challenge

Design and implement a narrative storyline that unfolds throughout the game, enhancing the player‚Äôs immersion and motivation to repair the spacecraft.
