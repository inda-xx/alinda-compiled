# üèóÔ∏è Advanced Object-Oriented Programming: Weather Station Simulation

Welcome to the Weather Station Simulation task! In this task, you'll expand your understanding of object-oriented programming while engaging with file I/O operations to create a more dynamic and interactive program. The ultimate goal is to design a weather station application that reads data from a configuration file and simulates varying weather conditions. You'll design classes, manage file I/O operations to instantiate objects, and unlock your creativity by designing an intuitive system.

## üéØ Learning Goals

- **Using Data from Files to Instantiate Objects**
  - Master the process of reading and parsing data from files.
  - Convert this data into meaningful objects.
  - Ensure robust error handling and data integrity.

- **Designing Classes**
  - Develop well-structured Java classes.
  - Define clear class responsibilities and interfaces.
  - Incorporate design patterns where applicable.

- **Programming Creatively**
  - Explore creative problem-solving techniques.
  - Experiment with different features and refine them.
  - Integrate user feedback to enhance the software experience.

## üìù Exercise 1: Understanding File Formats and Parsing

**Objective:** Familiarize yourself with different file formats you might encounter in programming tasks, and understand how they can be parsed.

**Instruction:** Answer the following theoretical questions:

1. **What are common file formats used for data exchange, and what are their characteristics?**
   - Consider JSON, XML, CSV, and plain text. Discuss the scenarios where each one is best utilized.

2. **Describe techniques to parse data from these file formats.**
   - Discuss libraries or standard techniques used in Java for handling these file types.

## üìù Exercise 2: Class Design Concepts

**Objective:** Strengthen your understanding of class design principles in object-oriented programming.

**Instruction:** Answer the following theoretical questions:

1. **Explain the S.O.L.I.D. principles of class design.**
   - Provide a brief description of each principle and how it contributes to effective class design.

2. **Discuss how design patterns can improve class structuring.**
   - Select one design pattern and describe how it enhances class design through separation of concerns.

## üíª Exercise 3: Reading Configuration Files

**Objective:** Practice writing Java code to read configuration files and instantiate objects.

**Task:** Implement a method in Java that reads a configuration file (e.g., `weather_config.txt`) and uses the data to create `WeatherStation` objects.

- The configuration file format:
  ```
  WeatherStation;Location;SensorType;Reading
  WeatherStation;New York;Temperature;22.5
  WeatherStation;Los Angeles;Humidity;60
  ```

- **Instructions:**
  - Write a method `private void loadWeatherStations(String filename)` to parse this file.
  - Instantiate `WeatherStation` objects with the data.
  - Handle exceptions and ensure data integrity.

Here's a basic code outline:

```java
private void loadWeatherStations(String filename) {
    // Initialize a List<WeatherStation>
    // Read the file line by line
    // Parse each line and instantiate WeatherStation objects
    // Handle exceptions
}
```

## üíª Exercise 4: Designing the WeatherStation Class

**Objective:** Apply class design principles to build a robust class structure.

**Task:** Implement the `WeatherStation` class based on the parsed configuration data.

- **Requirements:**
  - Attributes: `location`, `sensorType`, `reading`
  - Methods: A constructor, getters, and any utility methods (like `calculateForecast`).

- **Instructions:**
  - Ensure high cohesion within the class.
  - Use encapsulation properly.

---

## üöÄ Exercise 5: Extend Functionality with Design Patterns

**Objective:** Use design patterns to enhance your system's flexibility and scalability.

**Task:** Integrate a design pattern to manage different types of sensors (`TemperatureSensor`, `HumiditySensor`, etc.) in the `WeatherStation`.

- **Instructions:**
  - Implement the Factory Method Pattern to dynamically create sensor objects.
  - Consider adding feature to simulate sensor failure and recovery.

Here's an outline for the factory:

```java
public abstract class SensorFactory {
    public abstract Sensor createSensor(String sensorType);
}

public class WeatherStationSensorFactory extends SensorFactory {
    @Override
    public Sensor createSensor(String sensorType) {
        switch (sensorType) {
            case "Temperature":
                return new TemperatureSensor();
            case "Humidity":
                return new HumiditySensor();
            default:
                throw new IllegalArgumentException("Unknown sensor type: " + sensorType);
        }
    }
}
```

---

## üöÄ Exercise 6: Creative Expansion and User Interaction

**Objective:** Encourage creative programming and user interaction.

**Task:** Expand your WeatherStation application with additional features, focusing on user interaction and dynamic behavior.

- **Instructions:**
  - Allow users to request forecasts based on location.
  - Implement a simple console UI that displays weather data and forecasts.
  - Encourage experimenting with new features like historical data analysis or predictions.
