## 📚 Exercise 1: Understanding File Formats and Parsing

**Objective:** Gain a theoretical understanding of various file formats and parsing techniques.

**Instructions:**

- Research common file formats used in programming (e.g., CSV, JSON, XML).
- Explore different parsing techniques and tools available in Java for these file formats.
- Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each format and parsing strategy.

**Questions:**

1. What are the key differences between JSON, XML, and CSV formats?
2. Explain how you might parse a CSV file in Java. What libraries or classes could you use?

---

## 📘 Exercise 2: Class Design Principles

**Objective:** Deepen your understanding of class design principles.

**Instructions:**

- Review the principles of class design, including solid principles and design patterns.
- Analyze the potential impact of design patterns on class design.

**Questions:**

1. How do solid principles influence the design of classes in object-oriented programming?
2. Explain a design pattern you have studied and how it can be applied in class design.

## 🛠️ Exercise 3: Reading Data from Files in Java

**Objective:** Implement a basic program that reads data from a file and parses it.

**Instructions:**

- Create a small Java program that reads a CSV file containing a list of books with their titles, authors, and publication years.
- Implement logic to parse this data and print each book's details to the console.

**Starter Code Snippet:**

```java
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.IOException;

public class BookReader {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String filePath = "books.csv";
        String line;
        try (BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(filePath))) {
            while ((line = br.readLine()) != null) {
                String[] bookData = line.split(",");
                System.out.println("Title: " + bookData[0] + ", Author: " +
                                   bookData[1] + ", Year: " + bookData[2]);
            }
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

## 🏗️ Exercise 4: Designing a Book Class

**Objective:** Apply your class design skills to implement a `Book` class.

**Instructions:**

- Design a `Book` class that encapsulates the attributes `title`, `author`, and `year`.
- Implement constructors, getters, setters, and a `toString()` method.

**Challenge:**

- Ensure your class follows solid principles and apply a relevant design pattern if applicable.

---

## 🚀 Exercise 5: Dynamic Book Object Creation

**Objective:** Programmatically create `Book` objects from file data.

**Instructions:**

- Expand on your previous implementation to instantiate `Book` objects from file data.
- Store these objects in an appropriate collection, such as an `ArrayList`.

**Code Snippet:**

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public class BookLibrary {
    private List<Book> books;

    public BookLibrary() {
        books = new ArrayList<>();
    }

    public void addBook(Book book) {
        books.add(book);
    }

    // Additional methods to manage the library
}
```

**Step-by-step Tasks:**

1. Modify your file reading logic to create `Book` objects.
2. Add these objects to an `ArrayList<Book>` in a `BookLibrary` class.
3. Print the details of all books in the library.

---

## 🌟 Exercise 6: Creative Programming Challenge - Book Library Application

**Objective:** Develop a simple command-line application to manage your book library creatively.

**Instructions:**

- Extend your `BookLibrary` class to include features like searching books by title, sorting books by year, and deleting books.
- Implement input handling to allow users to interact with your application via the command line.

**Enhancements:**

- Experiment with additional features like saving the library state to a file or loading it at startup.
- Solicit feedback from a peer and iteratively refine your application based on their input.

**Step-by-step Tasks:**

1. Implement user input handling with a simple menu for library operations.
2. Add search, sort, and delete functionalities.
3. Optionally implement save/load functionalities for your library's state.

## ✔️ Final Check

Ensure that you:

- Thoroughly comment your code.
- Use meaningful class and method names.
- Handle exceptions gracefully, ensuring your application is robust.
- Test extensively.

This completes your task of using data from files to instantiate objects, designing classes, and creatively programming a functional application. You've harnessed the power of object-oriented programming and file I/O to build a meaningful software solution from scratch. Great job! 🎉

Keep exploring and applying these concepts to solve real-world problems creatively and effectively. Happy coding! 🚀
