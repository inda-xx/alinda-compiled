# Sci-Fi Themed Game Development Task 🚀🔭

Welcome to an exciting journey through the cosmos of programming! In this task, you will embark on a mission to create a Sci-Fi themed adventure game. This project will challenge your creativity and technical skills, integrating several key programming concepts, including using data from files, designing classes, and programming innovatively. Prepare to code your way through the universe, as you design a game set in a future where technology intersects imagination.

## Learning Goals 🌱

1. **Using Data from Files to Instantiate Objects**
   - Understand file formats and parsing techniques for data extraction.
   - Use file I/O classes to read data and convert it into object attributes.
   - Handle exceptions and ensure data integrity during object instantiation.

2. **Designing Classes**
   - Identify class responsibilities and define clear interfaces.
   - Implement cohesive class structures with appropriate fields and methods.
   - Leverage design patterns to solve common problems and enhance class design.

3. **Programming Creatively**
   - Explore different approaches to problem-solving and algorithm design.
   - Encourage experimentation and iteration to refine solutions.
   - Integrate user feedback and testing to improve program effectiveness and usability.

## Exercise 1: Conceptualizing File I/O for Objects 📂🔧

**Objective:** Deepen your understanding of how file data can be used to instantiate objects in Java.

**Task:**
- Discuss the advantages and potential challenges of using external files to store object data.
- Explain the process of parsing a CSV (Comma-Separated Values) file to extract data and instantiate game objects.
  
**Reflection Questions:**
1. What are the pros and cons of storing game data in files rather than hardcoding it in the program?
2. How would you design a method that reads from a CSV file and creates objects for a game?

---

## Exercise 2: The Art of Class Design 🎨📐

**Objective:** Explore best practices in designing robust and maintainable classes for your game.

**Task:**
- Identify key entities in a Sci-Fi themed game and define their responsibilities.
- Outline the interfaces for two classes, ensuring they cover the primary functionalities.

**Reflection Questions:**
1. How can you ensure that your classes remain cohesive and scalable as your game evolves?
2. Discuss the use of design patterns that could benefit a game development context.

## Exercise 3: Coding the Universe - Part I 🌌🛠️

**Objective:** Begin integrating file I/O and class design concepts into actual code.

**Task:**
- Implement a Java method to read a file containing alien species data and instantiate `Alien` objects.
  
**Example File Format:**
```
#File: aliens.csv
Species,Power,HomePlanet
Zorgon,Telepathy,Zeta-9
Tralvok,Invisibility,Nebula-3
```

**Instructions:**
- Create a class `Alien` with attributes for species, power, and home planet.
- Implement file reading logic using Java I/O classes, handling exceptions appropriately.

---

## Exercise 4: Coding the Universe - Part II 💾🪐

**Objective:** Extend your game by designing interactions and refining class structures.

**Task:**
- Design and implement an additional class, like `SpaceShip`, incorporating interactions with `Alien` objects.
  
**Instructions:**
- Develop methods that simulate spaceship features and interactions with aliens.
- Enhance your code by integrating feedback loops and user testing considerations.

## Exercise 5: The Great Cosmic Challenge - Part I 🌠🧩

**Objective:** Create a functioning prototype of your game, integrating all previous elements.

**Task:**
- Develop a method `generateUniverseFromFile` to dynamically create game worlds from file data. 

**Instructions:**
- File should describe the game world, including planets and connections between them.
- Ensure robust parsing and object creation, leveraging data transformation techniques.

<details>
<summary>Example Line Format</summary>

```
#File: universe.txt
Planet;Mars;Dusty and Red
Planet;Hyperion;Gleaming tech world
Connection;Mars;Hyperion;Wormhole
```
</details>

## Exercise 6: The Great Cosmic Challenge - Part II 🛸♻️

**Objective:** Finalize your game mechanics and story, employing creative problem-solving.

**Task:**
- Create a narrative woven through the game world with victory and loss conditions.

**Instructions:**
- Ensure the game's mechanics are engaged through player choices and actions.
- Iterate on your solution, and refine gameplay based on user testing and feedback.

---

## Submission Guidelines 📥

1. **Documentation:** Ensure all methods and classes have appropriate Javadoc comments, detailing usage and expected behavior.
2. **README:** Include a complete description of your game, how to play, and any unique features or challenges.
3. **Map of Game World:** Provide a visual representation of your game world, showing key locations and paths.

---

## 💡 Tips and Tricks

- **Plan Ahead:** Take time to sketch your game's story and flow on paper before diving into code.
- **Iterate Often:** Constantly iterate and test pieces of your game to ensure functionality and enjoyment.
- **Stay Organized:** Leverage Java's organizational power at every step, using packages and clean code techniques.

### Remember, each star map that guides a ship through the cosmos was charted one star at a time. Your journey in coding is no different. Aim for the stars! 🌟
