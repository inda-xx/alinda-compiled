### 🎲 Task: Building a Text-Based Blackjack Game

Welcome to the exciting world of game development! In this task, you'll be challenged to create a text-based version of Blackjack, a popular card game, while focusing on several key programming concepts. This task will test your understanding of reading data from files, designing object-oriented systems, and creatively applying programming techniques. 

#### 🏆 Learning Goals

1. **Using Data from Files to Instantiate Objects**
   - 🗃️ Understand file formats and parsing techniques.
   - 📄 Use file I/O classes to read data and populate object attributes.
   - 🛡️ Handle exceptions to maintain data integrity.

2. **Designing Classes**
   - 🏗️ Define clear class responsibilities and interfaces.
   - 🔧 Build cohesive classes with fields and methods.
   - 📜 Apply design patterns for robust class design.

3. **Programming Creatively**
   - 🌀 Explore different problem-solving approaches.
   - 🔍 Encourage creative iteration and experimentation.
   - 🧪 Integrate user feedback to improve functionality.

### 🧠 Exercise 1: Theoretical Foundations in File Handling

**Objective:** Gain a thorough understanding of how to use files for data management in Java.

1. **Question:** Explain the difference between CSV and JSON file formats. How might each be used in game development, specifically within our Blackjack theme?
   
2. **Discussion:** What are the main challenges associated with reading data from files? How can these challenges impact game performance and reliability?

---

### 🧠 Exercise 2: Object-Oriented Design Principles

**Objective:** Explore class design principles before jumping into implementation.

1. **Question:** How do encapsulation and inheritance enhance the design of a card game like Blackjack? Provide a brief design sketch of possible classes you might use (e.g., `Card`, `Deck`, `Player`, etc.).

2. **Discussion:** Discuss the importance of interfaces and abstract classes. How could these be utilized in the design of a Blackjack game?

### 💻 Exercise 3: Parsing File Data into Java Objects

**Objective:** Implement reading and parsing of card data from a file to instantiate game objects.

**Instructions:**
- Create a text file `cards.txt` that describes a standard deck. Each line should have a representation of a card (e.g., `2 of Hearts`, `King of Spades`).
- Implement a `Card` class and write a method `loadCardsFromFile(String filePath)` that reads from `cards.txt` and creates `Card` objects.

**Code Snippet Example:**

```java
public List<Card> loadCardsFromFile(String filePath) {
    List<Card> deck = new ArrayList<>();
    try (BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(filePath))) {
        String line;
        while ((line = reader.readLine()) != null) {
            // Parse line and create Card object
            // Add Card to deck
        }
    } catch (IOException e) {
        e.printStackTrace(); // Proper exception handling required
    }
    return deck;
}
```

### 💻 Exercise 4: Designing and Implementing Core Classes

**Objective:** Design key classes for the game and implement them using object-oriented principles.

**Instructions:**
- Design and implement classes: `Card`, `Deck`, `Player`, and `Dealer`.
- The `Deck` class should shuffle cards, while `Player` should manage a hand of cards and calculate their total.

**Design Pattern Application:**
Implement the Singleton pattern for the `Deck` class to ensure only one instance is used throughout the game.

---

### 🔥 Exercise 5: Game Logic and Flow

**Objective:** Assemble your game classes to create the flow of a Blackjack game.

**Instructions:**
- Create a `Game` class that orchestrates the game's flow: dealing cards, player decisions (hit/stand), and dealer logic.
- Implement logic to determine win/loss conditions.

**Challenges:**
- Add exception handling for invalid user inputs.
- Ensure the game accounts for Blackjack rules, such as bust conditions and soft/hard totals.

---

### 🕹️ Exercise 6: Testing and Creative Enhancements

**Objective:** Test your game thoroughly and add creative features to enhance gameplay.

**Instructions:**
- Write a test suite to thoroughly test your game's logic and ensure it meets standard Blackjack rules.
- Enhance your game creatively — consider adding a betting system, multiple player capability, or an AI dealer.

**Testing Example:**
Use Java's JUnit framework to ensure your classes and methods behave as expected.
