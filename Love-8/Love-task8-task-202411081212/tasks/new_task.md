# üÉè Text-Based Blackjack Game Development Task

## üéØ Overview

In this task, you will create a text-based blackjack game in Java. The goal is to apply and integrate key programming concepts such as using data from files to instantiate objects, designing classes, and programming creatively. This project will challenge you to think both theoretically and practically as you learn to design a complete software system from scratch.

## üìö Learning Goals

1. **Using Data from Files to Instantiate Objects**
   - Understanding file formats and parsing techniques for data extraction.
   - Using file I/O classes to read data and convert it into object attributes.
   - Handling exceptions and ensuring data integrity during object instantiation.

2. **Designing Classes**
   - Identifying class responsibilities and defining clear interfaces.
   - Implementing cohesive class structures with appropriate fields and methods.
   - Leveraging design patterns to solve common problems and enhance class design.

3. **Programming Creatively**
   - Exploring different approaches to problem-solving and algorithm design.
   - Encouraging experimentation and iteration to refine solutions.
   - Integrating user feedback and testing to improve program effectiveness and usability.

## üöÄ Task Structure

### Exercise 1: Understanding File Formats and Parsing Techniques

**Objective**: Grasp basic concepts of using file data to generate objects.

- **Task**: 
  - Explain how you would store data for playing cards in a plain text file. Consider the structure necessary to represent different suits (Clubs, Diamonds, Hearts, Spades) and values (Ace through King).
  - Discuss any potential parsing issues that could arise from your chosen format.

- **Deliverables**: A document detailing your file format and parsing strategy.

---

### Exercise 2: Designing a Basic Blackjack Game

**Objective**: Conceptual understanding of class design.

- **Task**: 
  - Outline the main classes and interfaces that would be essential for a blackjack game. 
  - Specify responsibilities for each class and the relationships between them. Consider aspects like `Deck`, `Card`, `Player`, `Dealer`, and `Game`.

- **Deliverables**: A UML class diagram or a detailed textual description of your class architecture.

---

### Exercise 3: Implementing File I/O in Java

**Objective**: Read data from files and use it for object creation.

- **Task**: 
  - Write a Java method `loadDeckFromFile(String filename)` in a `Deck` class that reads a file of card data and populates a deck.
  - Ensure your program handles file I/O exceptions and verifies data integrity.

```java
public class Deck {
    private List<Card> cards;
    
    public void loadDeckFromFile(String filename) {
        // Logic to read file and instantiate Card objects
    }
}
```

- **Deliverables**: Source code implementation of the file reading logic.

---

### Exercise 4: Basic Class Implementation

**Objective**: Apply class design concepts into code.

- **Task**: 
  - Implement the `Card`, `Deck`, and `Player` classes based on your design from Exercise 2.
  - Ensure each class has necessary fields, constructors, and methods.

```java
public class Card {
    private String suit;
    private String value;

    // Constructor, getters, and relevant methods
}
```

- **Deliverables**: Source code for `Card`, `Deck`, and `Player` classes.

---

### Exercise 5: Building the Game Logic

**Objective**: Develop the core functionality of a blackjack game.

- **Task**: 
  - Implement the `Game` class to manage the flow of a blackjack game, including dealing cards, handling player decisions (hit or stand), and determining winners.
  - Ensure the game is playable via the console with clear prompts and outcomes.

```java
public class Game {
    private Deck deck;
    private Player player;
    private Dealer dealer;
    
    public void play() {
        // Game logic here
    }
}
```

- **Deliverables**: A functioning text-based blackjack game.

---

### Exercise 6: Enhancing with Creative Features

**Objective**: Encourage creative programming by adding unique features.

- **Task**: 
  - Add at least two creative enhancements to your blackjack game. Ideas include:
    - A betting system where players start with a certain amount of money.
    - A scoring history for the player across multiple sessions.
    - Dynamic difficulty adjusting dealer strategies.

- **Deliverables**: Source code reflecting the creative additions to the game.

---

## üîç Testing and Evaluation

After completing all exercises, thoroughly test your game to ensure it works as expected. Consider edge cases and handle invalid inputs gracefully. Document your testing process and results.

---

## üìù Submission

Submit your completed project as a compressed file that includes:

- Source code files.
- UML diagrams or architectural documents.
- A README file with installation instructions and notes on your creative features.

Good luck, and enjoy the process of bringing your blackjack game to life! üéâ
