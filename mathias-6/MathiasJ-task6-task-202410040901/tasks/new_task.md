**üåü Casino Simulator: A Java Adventure üåü**

Welcome to the Casino Simulator task! Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to create a basic casino application using Java. This series of exercises will guide you through important concepts such as randomness, iteration, object-oriented programming, and more. Let's get ready to roll the dice, spin the wheel, and deal the cards!

### üìù Overview

This task covers key Java concepts:
- Understanding the `Random` object
- Using the ternary operator
- Distinguishing between deep and shallow copies
- Finding and fixing bugs
- Iterating over collections and safely modifying them
- (Optional) Utilizing inheritance for code reuse  

### üìö Exercises:

---

#### Exercise 1: üé≤ Randomness Theory

**Objective:** Understand the Java `Random` object.

‚≠ê **Task:**  

- Explain how the `Random` class is used to generate pseudo-random numbers. Describe the concept of a "seed" and its effect on the randomness of number generation.

ü§î **Questions:**
1. What is the main advantage of using `Random` over `Math.random()`?
2. How would setting a seed value affect the repeatability of a sequence of random numbers?

#### Exercise 2: ‚ùì Ternary Operator Mysteries

**Objective:** Grasp the use of the ternary operator in Java.

‚≠ê **Task:**  

- Provide a detailed explanation of how the ternary operator works, including its syntax and use-cases in Java.

ü§î **Questions:**
1. Rewrite the following `if-else` statement using the ternary operator:

    ```java
    if (balance > 0) {
        message = "Player is in the game!";
    } else {
        message = "Player is out of the game!";
    }
    ```

2. Discuss potential advantages and pitfalls of using the ternary operator in code.

#### Exercise 3: üÉè Implement a Simple Dice Game

**Objective:** Employ randomness and the ternary operator in a practical scenario.

‚≠ê **Task:**
Create a Java program that simulates a simple dice game where the player rolls two dice. The program should randomly determine the outcome using the `Random` object and decide if the player wins or loses using a ternary operator.

```java
public class DiceGame {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Implement your dice game here
    }
}
```

**Conditions:**
- If the sum of the dice is 7 or 11, the player wins.
- Otherwise, the player loses.

#### Exercise 4: üé¥ Card Deck - Deep vs Shallow Copy

**Objective:** Explore deep and shallow copying.

‚≠ê **Task:**

- Implement a `CardDeck` class that contains a collection of playing cards. Demonstrate how to correctly make a deep copy of the card collection. Highlight the difference from a shallow copy with examples.

```java
public class CardDeck {
    private List<Card> cards;

    // Implement methods to populate and copy the deck
}
```

ü§î **Questions:**
1. What is the potential hazard of using a shallow copy in gaming applications?
2. Illustrate, with a code example, the difference between deep and shallow copying.

#### Exercise 5: üîÑ Bug Hunt - Modify a Collection with Iterator

**Objective:** Use an `Iterator` to fix a collection modification error.

‚≠ê **Task:**

- Implement a Java method that iterates over a collection of players (names) and removes those who have lost all their money. Ensure that the collection is safely modified during iteration using an `Iterator`.

```java
public static void removeBankruptPlayers(List<String> players) {
    // Implement using Iterator
}
```

ü§î **Considerations:**
- Explain why modifying a collection during iteration can lead to exceptions and how an `Iterator` resolves this issue.

---

#### Exercise 6: ‚ô†Ô∏èüí° Casino Inheritance (Optional but Recommended)

**Objective:** Utilize inheritance to avoid code duplication.

‚≠ê **Task:**

- Design an abstract `Game` class with common game attributes and methods, such as `start()` and `end()`. Then extend this class to create two specific games, like `Blackjack` and `Roulette`.

```java
public abstract class Game {
    // Common attributes and methods
}

public class Blackjack extends Game {
    // Blackjack-specific implementations
}

public class Roulette extends Game {
    // Roulette-specific implementations
}
```

ü§î **Reflection:**
- Discuss how inheritance helps in reducing code duplication.
- What are potential disadvantages of using inheritance in this scenario?

### ‚öôÔ∏è Final Checklist:

- [ ] Exercises 1 & 2: Demonstrate understanding of the `Random` object and ternary operator.
- [ ] Exercices 3 & 4: Successfully implemented a dice game and card deck with deep copy.
- [ ] Exercise 5: Correctly used an `Iterator` to handle collection modifications.
- [ ] Exercise 6 (Optional): Designed an inheritance hierarchy for casino games.

### üèÅ Completion:

Upon finishing the exercises, you'll have a better understanding of Java's fundamental concepts applied in a creative and fun casino context. Remember, these tasks are not just about getting the code to work, but about understanding the underlying concepts that drive the solutions. Good luck, and enjoy your coding journey in the Casino Simulator! üåêüíª
