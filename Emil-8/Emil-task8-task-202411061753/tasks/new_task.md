## 🧠 Data Science Adventure: File-Driven Dynamic Object Creation Challenge

Welcome to an exciting programming journey where you'll dive into the world of data science by creating a dynamic Java application driven by real-world data. This task will challenge your understanding of file I/O operations, class design principles, and creative problem-solving skills. By the end, you'll have a robust Java application capable of reading data from files and instantiating objects based on that data. Let's get started!

---

### 📜 Exercise 1: Understanding File Formats and Data Parsing

**Objective**: Explore the theoretical underpinnings of file formats and data parsing techniques.

- **Task**: 
  - Explain the differences between structured (e.g., CSV, JSON), semi-structured (e.g., XML), and unstructured data.
  - Discuss the challenges involved in parsing each type of data and the tools or libraries that can aid in their parsing within Java.

**Example Response**: 

> "Structured data like CSV files have a predefined format which makes parsing straightforward using libraries like OpenCSV. Semi-structured data like XML can be parsed using DOM or SAX parsers available in Java. Unstructured data requires natural language processing techniques because it doesn't follow a predictable format."

### 🖥️ Exercise 2: Exception Handling in Data Processing

**Objective**: Demonstrate the importance of exception handling and data integrity during object instantiation.

- **Task**:
  - Describe the types of exceptions that can occur during file I/O operations in Java and their potential impact on data integrity.
  - Outline a strategy for ensuring data integrity when reading from a file and instantiating objects in Java.

**Example Concepts**: 

> "Common exceptions are `IOException` for file access errors and `NumberFormatException` for invalid data conversions. To maintain data integrity, use try-catch blocks to handle exceptions carefully and validate data prior to object instantiation."

### 🔧 Exercise 3: Designing Your Data Class

**Objective**: Develop a Java class that models a real-world data object.

- **Task**:
  - Design a class (e.g., `WeatherData`) with attributes suitable for the data being parsed (e.g., temperature, humidity, pressure).
  - Implement methods to access and modify these attributes, ensuring your class demonstrates encapsulation.

**Code Skeleton**:

```java
public class WeatherData {
    private double temperature;
    private double humidity;
    private double pressure;
    
    public WeatherData(double temperature, double humidity, double pressure) {
        this.temperature = temperature;
        this.humidity = humidity;
        this.pressure = pressure;
    }
    
    public double getTemperature() {
        return temperature;
    }
    
    public void setTemperature(double temperature) {
        this.temperature = temperature;
    }

    // Add remaining getters and setters for humidity and pressure
}
```

### 📊 Exercise 4: Implementing File-Driven Instantiation

**Objective**: Write code to read data from a file and instantiate objects using your designed class.

- **Task**:
  - Create a method that reads data from a CSV file, parses the data, and creates `WeatherData` objects for each line.
  - Handle any potential exceptions and ensure that each object is instantiated with valid data only.

**Code Example**:

```java
public List<WeatherData> readWeatherData(String filename) {
    List<WeatherData> weatherList = new ArrayList<>();
    try (BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(filename))) {
        String line;
        while ((line = br.readLine()) != null) {
            String[] values = line.split(",");
            double temperature = Double.parseDouble(values[0]);
            double humidity = Double.parseDouble(values[1]);
            double pressure = Double.parseDouble(values[2]);
            weatherList.add(new WeatherData(temperature, humidity, pressure));
        }
    } catch (IOException | NumberFormatException e) {
        System.err.println("Error reading file: " + e.getMessage());
    }
    return weatherList;
}
```

### 🚀 Exercise 5: Enhancing Class Responsibilities with Design Patterns

**Objective**: Enhance the cohesion and usability of your class using design patterns.

- **Task**:
  - Identify a suitable design pattern (e.g., Factory Pattern) to enhance object creation in your application.
  - Implement the chosen design pattern to streamline the instantiation process of `WeatherData` objects.

**Hints**:

> The Factory Pattern can abstract the creation logic and centralize object creation, making your code more maintainable and scalable.

### 🎨 Exercise 6: Creative Data Visualization

**Objective**: Apply creative programming techniques to visualize the data you've modeled.

- **Task**:
  - Use a Java GUI library (e.g., JavaFX) to develop a basic application that visualizes the `WeatherData` you've parsed.
  - Experiment with various visualization forms (e.g., line graphs, bar charts) to represent the data creatively.

**Code Example Outline**:

```java
public class WeatherVisualizer extends Application {

    @Override
    public void start(Stage stage) {
        // Set up your data visualization logic here using JavaFX components
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        launch(args);
    }
}
```
