### üìö Exercise 1: Understanding the Three-Body Problem

**Objective:** Deepen your theoretical understanding of the three-body problem.

1. Describe the three-body problem in classical physics. What makes it distinct from two-body problems?
2. Explain why the three-body problem generally does not have a closed-form solution. Discuss any known special cases or approximations that exist.

### üìö Exercise 2: Data Formats and Parsing Techniques

**Objective:** Grasp the file formats and parsing techniques needed for data extraction.

1. Describe the typical formats for storing astrophysical data (e.g., CSV, JSON, XML) and discuss the pros and cons of each in the context of simulation data.
2. Outline a strategy for parsing data from a chosen format to instantiate objects. Include considerations for error handling and data integrity.

### üíª Exercise 3: Designing the CelestialBody Class

**Objective:** Integrate class design principles by creating a `CelestialBody` class.

1. Design a `CelestialBody` class in Java that encapsulates properties like mass, position, and velocity.
   
   ```java
   public class CelestialBody {
       private double mass;
       private double[] position; // {x, y, z}
       private double[] velocity; // {vx, vy, vz}

       public CelestialBody(double mass, double[] position, double[] velocity) {
           this.mass = mass;
           this.position = position;
           this.velocity = velocity;
       }

       // Getters and setters
   }
   ```

2. Explain the role of each field and method in your class, ensuring cohesion and encapsulation.

### üíª Exercise 4: Importing Data to Instantiate Celestial Bodies

**Objective:** Combine file I/O with object instantiation.

1. Write a method `loadCelestialBodiesFromFile(String filename)` to read celestial body data from a file and instantiate corresponding objects.

    - Use appropriate Java file I/O classes.
    - Ensure robust error handling and data validation.

2. Demonstrate your method with a sample data file. Assume the file format is CSV, with columns for mass, position (x, y, z), and velocity (vx, vy, vz).

### üöÄ Exercise 5: Simulating the Three-Body Interactions

**Objective:** Simulate the gravitational interactions among three celestial bodies.

1. Implement a method to calculate gravitational forces between bodies and update their positions and velocities over time. Use Newton's laws of motion and gravitation.

   ```java
   public void simulate(double timeStep) {
       // Calculate gravitational forces
       // Update positions and velocities
   }
   ```

2. Provide a visual or text-based output of the simulation results over a given period.

---

### üöÄ Exercise 6: Creative Extensions to the Simulation

**Objective:** Apply creative problem-solving to enhance your simulation.

1. Extend your simulation by allowing dynamic file input that modifies celestial properties mid-simulation.
2. Add visualization using a simple 2D or 3D graphics library to animate the movement of celestial bodies.
3. Experiment with different initial conditions and observe how they affect the simulation outcome.

4. Write a report discussing:
   - The challenges faced and how you overcame them.
   - The insights gained from simulating different scenarios.
   - Potential applications of your simulation in real-world scenarios.
