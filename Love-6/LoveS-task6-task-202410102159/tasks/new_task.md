### 🎮 Higher or Lower Game Task

Welcome to the Higher or Lower Game programming task! In this tutorial, you will build a simple game where the user guesses if a randomly generated number will be higher or lower than the previous one. This project will help you understand essential concepts in Java like the `Random` object, the ternary operator, deep versus shallow copies, and more. Let’s build something fun and challenging!

---

#### 💡 Learning Goals:
- Grasp the `Random` object usage for generating random numbers.
- Utilize the ternary operator for concise conditional logic.
- Differentiate between deep and shallow copies in Java.
- Employ debugging techniques to find and fix bugs.
- Use an `Iterator` for safe collection modification during iteration.
- **Optional**: Implement inheritance to avoid code duplication.

### Exercise 1: Understanding Randomness 🎲
**Objective:** Familiarize yourself with the `Random` class in Java.

**Task:** Go through the [Java `Random` class documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/util/Random.html) and answer the following questions:
  - What are the common methods available in the `Random` class and what do they return?
  - How does Java ensure the randomness of the numbers generated by `Random`?

**Note:** Write your answers in a separate document named `Knowledge.md` in your project folder.

### Exercise 2: Ternary Operations 🤔
**Objective:** Understand the usage of the ternary operator in Java.

**Task:** Consider the following scenario and explain the code:

```java
int guess = (userChoice == 'h') ? ++currentNumber : --currentNumber;
```

- What does the ternary operator do?
- How is it beneficial compared to using traditional `if-else` statements?

**Deliverable:** Continue using `Knowledge.md` to document your insights.

### Exercise 3: Implementing the Guessing Logic 🧩
**Objective:** Start building the core logic of the Higher or Lower game.

**Task:** Create a Java class named `HigherLowerGame` and implement a method:
```java
public boolean guessHigherOrLower(char userInput, int currentNumber, int nextNumber)
```
This method should use a ternary operator to determine if the user's guess (either 'h' for higher or 'l' for lower) was correct based on the two numbers provided.

**Example Usage:**
```java
// Assuming currentNumber was 4 and nextNumber is 7
guessHigherOrLower('h', 4, 7); // Returns true
```

---

### Exercise 4: Deep vs Shallow Copies 🔍
**Objective:** Understand and demonstrate deep and shallow copying in collections.

**Task:** In the same `HigherLowerGame` class, add a method:
```java
public static List<Integer> duplicateList(List<Integer> original, boolean deepCopy)
```
- Implement logic to perform a shallow or deep copy based on the boolean flag. 
- Use deep copy to create a new list with the same values as the `original`.

**Example:**
```java
List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3);
List<Integer> copiedNumbers = duplicateList(numbers, true);
```

---

### Exercise 5: Bug Detection and Resolution 🔧
**Objective:** Identify and resolve bugs in code.

**Task:** You're provided with a faulty method:
```java
public void printNumbersAndStates(List<Integer> numbers) {
    for (Integer number : numbers) {
        // Assume some logic printing number and state
        numbers.remove(0); // Intentional bug for removal during iteration
    }
}
```
- Fix this bug using an `Iterator`.

**Hint:** Use the `Iterator`'s `remove()` method instead of the list's.

---

### Exercise 6: Game Logic and Inheritance 🏆
**Objective:** End-to-end game logic with optional inheritance to reduce duplication.

**Task:** 
1. Expand `HigherLowerGame` to include:
    ```java
    public void playGame()
    ```
    - Use the `Random` class to generate numbers.
    - Continuously prompt the user to guess higher or lower.
    - Record and display the ongoing score.

2. **Optional**: Implement a superclass, `Game`, with basic methods that can be inherited by `HigherLowerGame` to minimize code duplication (like initializing the score, resetting the game, etc.).

**Deliverables:** 
- A working console application.
- Use `System.in` and `System.out` for user interaction.
- Introduce a winning or losing condition after a set number of rounds.

### 📈 Conclusion
By completing this task, you should have a functional "Higher or Lower" game and a deeper understanding of Java's essential concepts. Your final project should be engaging, interactive, and demonstrate an efficient use of Java's features!

Good luck, and happy coding! 🚀
