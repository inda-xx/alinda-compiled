# üìö Java Programming Task: Mastering Matrix Multiplication

Welcome to this comprehensive programming task designed to enhance your understanding of arrays of arrays, matrix multiplication, and several pertinent Java programming concepts. This task will guide you through a series of exercises that progressively build your skills, culminating in the development of a matrix multiplication program. We'll cover essential topics such as matrix manipulation, the Java `Random` object, ternary operators, deep vs. shallow copies, bug investigation, and more.

## üìù Exercise 1: Theoretical Foundations of the Java `Random` Object

**Objective**: Understand how to utilize the Java `Random` object in the context of matrix operations.

**Task**:
- Research the Java `Random` class. Explain how it can be used to generate random numbers, potentially useful for creating random matrices.
- What are the different methods provided by the `Random` class, and how do they facilitate the generation of numbers in specific ranges?

**Example Explanation**:
```java
Random random = new Random();
int randomInt = random.nextInt(10); // Generates a random integer between 0 and 9
double randomDouble = random.nextDouble(); // Generates a random double between 0.0 and 1.0
```

## üß† Exercise 2: Exploring the Ternary Operator

**Objective**: Develop a conceptual understanding of the ternary operator and its usage in matrix operations.

**Task**:
- Describe how the ternary operator works in Java. When might it be preferable to an `if-else` statement?
- Consider a situation where you want to set the element of a matrix to a particular value based on a condition: How could the ternary operator be used here?

**Thought Exercise**:
Evaluate the expression `matrix[i][j] = condition ? value1 : value2;` and describe a scenario where this could be applied within a matrix operation.

## üíª Exercise 3: Implementing and Understanding Deep vs. Shallow Copy

**Objective**: Implement matrix copying, emphasizing deep and shallow copy differences.

**Task**:
- Write a Java method to perform a deep copy of a matrix. Ensure that alterations in the copied matrix do not affect the original.
- Implement a shallow copy and explain the impact of modifications in the original on the copy.

**Example Code**:
```java
public int[][] deepCopyMatrix(int[][] original) {
    int[][] copy = new int[original.length][];
    for (int i = 0; i < original.length; i++) {
        copy[i] = original[i].clone();
    }
    return copy;
}
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Exercise 4: Identifying and Fixing Bugs in Matrix Manipulation

**Objective**: Analyze and correct bugs in a provided matrix addition function.

**Task**:
- A code snippet is provided that attempts to add two matrices. Identify any errors or inefficiencies.

**Code Snippet**:
```java
public int[][] addMatrices(int[][] matrixA, int[][] matrixB) {
    int[][] result = new int[matrixA.length][matrixA[0].length];
    for (int i = 0; i < matrixA.length; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < matrixA[i].length; j++) {
            result[i][j] = matrixA[i][j] + matrixB[i][j]; // What error might this line produce?
        }
    }
    return result;
}
```

- Fix the code to handle errors gracefully, such as differing matrix sizes.

## üîç Exercise 5: Modify a Matrix Using Iterators

**Objective**: Utilize an `Iterator` to modify a collection.

**Task**:
- Given a matrix stored as a collection of `ArrayList<Integer>`, write a method that doubles all even numbers in the matrix using an `Iterator`.

**Example Code**:
```java
public void doubleEvens(List<ArrayList<Integer>> matrix) {
    for (ArrayList<Integer> row : matrix) {
        ListIterator<Integer> iterator = row.listIterator();
        while (iterator.hasNext()) {
            int value = iterator.next();
            iterator.set(value % 2 == 0 ? value * 2 : value);
        }
    }
}
```

## üöÄ Exercise 6: Advanced Matrix Multiplication with Code Optimization

**Objective**: Implement matrix multiplication, applying inheritance to avoid code duplication.

**Task**:
- Design a base class `Matrix` with common functionality for matrices (e.g., addition, display).
- Extend this class to create a `MultipliableMatrix` class, which includes matrix multiplication.

**Guidelines**:
- Ensure the multiplication only proceeds if the matrices have compatible dimensions.
- Apply the use of the ternary operator for concise logic where applicable.

**Example Structure**:
```java
public class Matrix {
    protected int[][] data;
    // Common methods here
}

public class MultipliableMatrix extends Matrix {
    public int[][] multiply(MultipliableMatrix other) {
        // Logic for multiplication
    }
}
```
