# üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Text-Based Adventure: Create Your Fantasy Quest

Welcome adventurer! Your task is to create an enchanting text-based adventure game where players navigate through a fantasy world filled with mysterious locations, peculiar characters, and thrilling challenges. You'll harness the power of object-oriented programming to bring this world to life using data from files. Embark on this journey to master class design and creative programming!

## üéØ Learning Goals

This task aims to help you develop the following skills:

1. **Using Data from Files to Instantiate Objects**
   - Understand file formats and parsing techniques.
   - Use file I/O classes to read data and convert it into object attributes.
   - Handle exceptions and ensure data integrity.

2. **Designing Classes**
   - Identify class responsibilities and define clear interfaces.
   - Implement cohesive class structures with appropriate fields and methods.
   - Leverage design patterns to enhance class design.

3. **Programming Creatively**
   - Explore different approaches to problem-solving.
   - Encourage experimentation and iteration to refine solutions.
   - Integrate user feedback to improve program effectiveness and usability.

## üß© Exercises

### ‚ú® Exercise 1: Understanding File Formats and Parsing Techniques

**Objective**: Analyze the structure of game data files.

**Task**: 
- Examine the provided `game_data.txt` file. It contains information on rooms, items, and links in the format:
  ```
  Room;RoomName;Description
  Item;ItemName;Effect
  Link;FromRoom;Direction;ToRoom
  ```

- **Question**: Explain how this file format allows for easy parsing and potential challenges you might face. Consider errors, incomplete entries, and file structure complications.

---

### üîé Exercise 2: Designing the Game Classes

**Objective**: Map out the class structure for your adventure game.

**Task**:
- Sketch the architecture of your game, defining at least three primary classes: `Room`, `Item`, and `Player`.
- **Question**: Describe the roles and responsibilities of each class and the methods you'll implement. Provide reasoning for your design choices, considering scalability and maintainability.

---

### üõ† Exercise 3: Reading Data and Instantiating Objects

**Objective**: Write code to load game data from a file.

**Task**:
- Implement a Java method `loadGameData(String filename)` in your main game class to read and parse the `game_data.txt` file.
- Instantiate `Room` and `Item` objects based on the file's contents.

**Hint**: Use `BufferedReader` and handle exceptions to ensure robust reading.

```java
public void loadGameData(String filename) {
    try (BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(filename))) {
        String line;
        while ((line = br.readLine()) != null) {
            // Parse line and instantiate objects
        }
    } catch (IOException e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
    }
}
```

---

### üß© Exercise 4: Creating Interactive Game Mechanics

**Objective**: Implement player interactions within your game world.

**Task**:
- Develop methods in the `Player` class to allow picking up and using items.
- Write code to link rooms based on player commands (e.g., "go north").

**Hint**: Use a Map to store room links dynamically.

---

### üöÄ Exercise 5: Building Your Adventure Game

**Objective**: Bring your text-based game to life!

**Task**:
- Expand your game with at least 5 connected rooms, each with unique descriptions and challenges.
- Integrate a winning condition (e.g., reaching a specific room with certain items) and a losing scenario (e.g., taking too long).

**Steps**:
1. Draft a flow of your story with different paths and outcomes.
2. Implement these paths into your game's code.

**Tip**: Get creative with items and player interactions!

---

### üåü Exercise 6: Enhancing Game Experience and Documentation

**Objective**: Polish your game with creative features and comprehensive documentation.

**Task**:
- Add unique features like characters with simple dialogues or puzzles to solve.
- Document your game code with Javadoc, covering all public classes and methods.

**Deliverables**:
- A detailed README with gameplay instructions, class descriptions, and how to run your game.
- A creative map illustrating the game world layout.
